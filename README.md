An Implementation of Membership Protocol based on GOSSIP.

#What is the project?
The project is about implementing a Gossip Protocol.
The main functionalities of the project :
Introduction : Each new peer contacts a well-known peer (the introducer) to join the group.
Membership : A membership protocol satisfies completeness all the time (for joins and failures), and accuracy when there are no message delays or losses (high accuracy when there are losses or delays).
